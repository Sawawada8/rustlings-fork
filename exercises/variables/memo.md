## const
定数は let と異なり、常に型を指定する必要あり

We know about variables and mutability, but there is another important type of
variable available: constants.
Constants are always immutable and they are declared with keyword 'const' rather
than keyword 'let'.
Constants types must also always be annotated.

Read more about constants and the differences between variables and constants under 'Constants' in the book's section 'Variables and Mutability':
